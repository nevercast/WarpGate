The Elder Trolls
===============
# Warp Gate #

Hello, I'm NeverCast, a programmer with The Elder Trolls development team. We work on a lot of projects, and have a wide range of hobbies. We are also very enthusiastic Minecraft players and have started working on our first mod for MC. We will be using Forge 4.2.5 ( Or higher ) as the framework to make sure our mods are compatible with your favourites!

Warp Gate is our first mod and we're not sure where we're going with it, but it will offer teleportation and other cool things. It's basically a learning curve for us.

Thanks for stopping by, hope to offer something awesome soon.
